# GitHub Pages

This repo uses GitHub pages to deploy the slides. This means attendees can access slides and we don't have to distribute code for people to complete the workshop. 

To do this, documents that need deploying (in our case, html documents created in quarto) should be either copied to a `docs/` directory or the root folder. Then head to GitHub and activate GitHub pages. I'm not putting in instructions for this, as there is far better instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
