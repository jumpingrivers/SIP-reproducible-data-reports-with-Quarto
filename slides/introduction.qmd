# Quarto

## What?

- Tool created by RStudio

- Let's us write documents that combine code with text

- Multiple language and multiple output formats

- Effectively a "version 2" of R Markdown

- File extension `.qmd`

## What?

## Where?

- [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

## Why?

- R Markdown isn't going anywhere

- So why should we be using Quarto instead?

## Why?

Vs R Markdown:

- Quarto is **not** an R package

- Publishing system built on Pandoc

## Why?

Vs R Markdown:

- Better multi-language support 
     - Use Python, Julia and Observable JS without having to have R installed (!!!!!!)

- Can be used in:
  - RStudio
  - VS Code 
  - Jupyter Notebookes
  - Text editors / terminal
  
## Why?

Vs R Markdown:

- IMO better documentation

- More user friendly

- Better control of the output layouts

- Can still render most R Markdown files without modification

# The plan

## Part 1

- Look at Quarto basics:
  - Creating a document
  - Document parameters
  - Including code
  - Including tables, plots

## Part 2

- Walk through a few different outputs in quarto

## The plan

- At the end you'll have an example of a
  - HTML document
  - presentation
  - dashboard (ish)
  
- You'll be able to download every file

- Slides are available on [GitHub](link)
